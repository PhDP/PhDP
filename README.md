### Hello ðŸŒŽ!

- Iâ€™m working on probabilistic programming with dependently typed Î»-calculi, the hope is to combine Bayesian probabilistic reasoning with mathematical reasoning.
- I â™¥ programming, especially with functional languages (Haskell, Lean, Agda) or languages for high-performance (Rust, Cuda, C, modern C++).
- Current position: post-doctoral researcher at the [UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al](https://www.umontreal.ca/)'s [Poisot lab](https://poisotlab.io/).
- The best way to reach me is via email (but be patient, I don't check my emails every day): [philippe.desjardins.proulx@umontreal.ca](mailto:philippe.desjardins.proulx@umontreal.ca).
